            <p>My name is Matt Halder. I am an aspiring web developer currently living in Minnesota. I had no previous
              experience in web development before 2023 and have an undergraduate degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota. I also earned a post-graduate certificate in Sport and Exercise Nutrition from Leeds Beckett University in Leeds, England. I am an avid soccer fan and support Chelsea in the English
              Premier League. I also enjoy reading and playing video games in my free time.</p><br></br>
            <p>I am a soon to be graduate from the Full-Time Coding Bootcamp in Web Develpoment through the University of Minnesota. I have learned how to design both the front and back-end of applications through this program and particularly enjoy seeing a program come together after some hard work. I also enjoy the problem solving aspects of coding and working through a problem to try and create a functional app. A more comprehensive list of my skills can be found on my resume page.</p>
